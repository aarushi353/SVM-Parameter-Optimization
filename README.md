# SVM-Parameter-Optimization

## Assignment
Choose any multi-class dataset from UCI library. Dataset size must have rows between 5k and 30k. Divide the dataset into 70-30 for training and testing with 10 different samples. Optimize the SVM for every sample with 1000 iterations and report the best parameters. Plot the convergence graph for the sample whose accuracy is maximum.

## Results

Kernel : rbf <br>
C : 1.098776 <br>
Gamma : 0.349813 <br>

The above parameter gave a maximum accuracy of 0.9933.
